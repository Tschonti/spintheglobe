## Spin the Globe!
Spin the Globe! is a mobile app that generates random vacations for you with a single click! You can save the vacations for later, if you found one that's for you. You can also change your preferences, so you'll only get locations in mountains, cities or at beaches.

#TODO: Show photos of the location using Google Places Photos API

The project was built with React Native and Expo, using React-Navigation v5, React-redux and more.
The project uses Google's Geocoding, Places and Elevation API, Geobytes GetNearbyCities API and OpenDataSet's worldcitiespop API.

The project is not deployed, because Google's API has restricted usage.
